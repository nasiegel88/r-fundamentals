How to utilize `...` at the end of functions in R. As a reminder `...` tells R to pass any additional arguments into the function.
```{r}
foo = function(dir, f = list.files(dir, ...), ...) {
  i = file.info(f)
  f[order(i$size, decreasing = TRUE)]
}
z = foo(".")
class(z)
head(z)
```

Using `...` when creating a function to generate a plot, we can pass additional arugments that will included in plot. In this example `cex =2` and `nonsense = 1` are passed through `...`.
```{r}
g = function(x, ...) { plot(1:length(x), x, main = "Title", ...)}
g(rnorm(10), cex = 2, nonsense = 1)
```

The source function allows users to run R scripts in different scripts. By default source runs scripts as if they are being entered directly into a current session. However, if one wanted to stop this behavior the local argument can be set to FALSE.
```{r}
source
```
